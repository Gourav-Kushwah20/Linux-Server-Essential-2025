## 📌 Quick Examples

```bash
head -n 10 file.txt            # 🔝 First 10 lines of a file
tail -f log.txt                # 🔚 Follow new lines added to a log
wc -l words.txt                # 🔢 Count lines in a file
sort data.txt                  # 📑 Sort file content
cut -d',' -f2 data.csv         # ✂️ Get the second field from CSV
paste file1.txt file2.txt      # 🔗 Combine lines side by side
grep "error" syslog.log        # 🔍 Find lines containing "error"
awk '{print $1}' names.txt     # 📊 Print the first word of each line
sed 's/foo/bar/g' input.txt    # 🛠️ Replace "foo" with "bar"
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < input.txt     # 🛠️ Convert text to uppercase
```
## 📌 Common Examples

### 1. Search for a Word in a File
```bash
grep "error" logfile.txt
```
### 2. Replace Text in a String
```bash
echo "hello world" | sed 's/world/Linux/'
```
### 3. Extract the 2nd Column from a CSV
```bash
cut -d',' -f2 file.csv
```
### 4. Convert Lowercase to Uppercase
```bash
echo "linux" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
```
### 5. Trim Whitespace (Leading & Trailing)
```bash
echo "  hello world  " | awk '{$1=$1; print}'
```
