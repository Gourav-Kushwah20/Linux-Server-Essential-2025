## 🔢 `wc` Command

The `wc` (word count) command is used to count **lines**, **words**, and **characters (bytes)** in a file.

---

### 📄 Example

```bash
wc /etc/passwd
```
Output:
```bash
  34   77 1911 /etc/passwd
```
#### 🧾 Output Breakdown:

- `34`: Number of lines

- `77`: Number of words

- `1911`: Number of bytes

- `/etc/passwd`: The file being analyzed
### 📄 Basic Usage
Displays the number of lines, words, and bytes in `/var/log/messages.`
```bash
wc /var/log/messages
```

Counts only the number of lines.
```bash
wc -l /var/log/messages
```
Counts only the number of words.
```bash
wc -w /var/log/messages
```
Counts only the number of bytes (characters)
```bash
wc -c /var/log/messages
```
## 📁 Multiple Files
```bash
wc /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/group /etc/gshadow
```
Shows line, word, and byte counts for each file, followed by a total summary.

## 🗂️ Wildcard Usage
Runs `wc` on all files in the current directory.
```bash
wc *
```
Count lines, words, and bytes in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`:
```bash
wc /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
```

Counts lines, words, and bytes in all `.conf` files located in the /`etc` directory.

```bash
wc /etc/*.conf
```
Count only the number of lines in each `.conf` file in `/etc:`

```bash
wc -l /etc/*.conf
```
List one file per line and count them:
```bash
ls -1 | wc -l
```
- `ls -1` lists each file/directory on a separate line.

- `wc -l` counts how many lines (i.e., how many items).

List files in long format and count lines:
```bash
ls -l | wc -l
```
Include hidden files and count all lines:
```bash
ls -al | wc -l
```
## Process Management
Show active processes (simple):
```bash
ps
```
- Displays currently running processes for the current shell/session.
```bash
ps -aux
```
Show all processes with detailed info:
```bash
ps -aux | wc -l
```
- Lists all running processes for all users.

- Includes detailed memory, CPU usage, and process hierarchy.

✅ Note: ps aux (without the dash) is the preferred format for portability. ps -aux may still work on many systems but is considered legacy.
